### CSPP monthly holding importer

You can use the `php bin/console import:corporate-bond-securities --until 03-10-2017` command to import data from the ECB.

The data that is being imported now is the data from the [weekly holding reports](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/implement/app/html/index.en.html). Other possibly interesting data are found in the [daily liquidity conditions](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/minimum_reserves/html/index.en.html) and the [history of cumulative purchases](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/pdf/CSPP_breakdown_history.csv)
